/**
 * A perspective descriptor describes a perspective in an
 * <code>IPerspectiveRegistry</code>.
 * <p>
 * A perspective is a template for view visibility, layout, and action
 * visibility within a workbench page. There are two types of perspective: a
 * predefined perspective and a custom perspective.
 * <ul>
 * <li>A predefined perspective is defined by an extension to the workbench's
 * perspective extension point (<code>"org.eclipse.ui.perspectives"</code>). The
 * extension defines a id, label, and <code>IPerspectiveFactory</code>. A
 * perspective factory is used to define the initial layout for a page.</li>
 * <li>A custom perspective is defined by the user. In this case a predefined
 * perspective is modified to suit a particular task and saved as a new
 * perspective. The attributes for the perspective are stored in a separate file
 * in the workbench's metadata directory.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Within a page the user can open any of the perspectives known to the
 * workbench's perspective registry, typically by selecting one from the
 * workbench's <code>Open Perspective</code> menu. When selected, the views and
 * actions within the active page rearrange to reflect the perspective.
