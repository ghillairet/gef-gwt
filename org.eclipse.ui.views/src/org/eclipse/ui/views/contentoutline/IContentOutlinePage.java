/**
 * Marker-style interface for a content outline page. This interface defines the
 * minimum requirement for pages within the content outline view, namely they
 * must be pages (implement <code>IPage</code>) and provide selections
 * (implement <code>ISelectionProvider</code>).
 * <p>
 * Access to a content outline page begins when an editor is activated. When
 * activation occurs, the content outline view will ask the editor for its
 * content outline page. This is done by invoking
 * <code>getAdapter(IContentOutlinePage.class)</code> on the editor. If the
 * editor returns a page, the view then creates the controls for that page
 * (using <code>createControl</code>) and makes the page visible.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface from scratch, or subclass the abstract
 * base class <code>ContentOutlinePage</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface extends <code>ISelectionProvider</code>. This is no
 * longer required in the case of implementors who also implement
 * <code>IPageBookViewPage</code> (or extend <code>Page</code>) as they are now
 * passed an <code>IPageSite</code> during their initialization and this site
 * can be configured with a selection provider. However to avoid a breaking
 * change 1) this interface will continue to extend ISelectionProvider 2) if an
 * IContentOutlinePage does not set a selection provider for its site, the
 * ContentOutline will continue to use the page itself for this purpose.
 * </p>
