/**
 * A label provider maps an element of the viewer's model to
 * an optional image and optional text string used to display
 * the element in the viewer's control.  Certain label providers
 * may allow multiple labels per element.
 * This is an "abstract interface", defining methods common
 * to all label providers, but does not actually define the methods
 * to get the label(s) for an element.  This interface should never
 * be directly implemented.
 * Most viewers will take either an <code>ILabelProvider</code> or
 * an <code>ITableLabelProvider</code>.
 * <p>
 * A label provider must not be shared between viewers
 * since a label provider generally manages SWT resources (images),
 * which must be disposed when the viewer is disposed.
 * To simplify life cycle management, the current label provider
 * of a viewer is disposed when the viewer is disposed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Label providers can be used outside the context of viewers wherever
 * images are needed.  When label providers are used in this fashion
 * it is the responsibility of the user to ensure <code>dispose</code>
 * is called when the provider is no longer needed.
